1 REQUIREMENTS
  PAT tools are written in python (a scripting language for details see
  http://www.python.org).
  
  For the command line tools you need to have installed python version 2.3 or
  newer. This software was developed on a LINUX operating system. It may work
  also under windows (TM), but it has never been tryed or tested.
  
  If you want to use the graphic tools (Disp.py, Plot.py, Show.py, Rescale.py)
  you need to have installed a X-server, python version 2.4 and python-qt3.
  
  
2a INSTALLATION (Linux)
  PAT is written in python, no compilation procedure is required.
  You need only to copy the files to a suitable directory and set two
  environment variables. Copying the files can be done by an installation script
  included in the package. The environment variables must be set by hand.
  
  Installation of the PAT tools requires the following steps:

   1. Get the compressed archive (tgz or zip) from the pat home page
      http://www.ifp.tuwien.ac.at/pat/
   2. Copy the archive to a intermediate directory
   3. Unpack your tar/zip-file pat-v.v.vv-xxxx.tgz[zip] in this directory.
      where v.v.vv stands for the version number and xxxx stands either for
      general or graphic if the command line tools or the graphic tools are
      included.
      tgz: tar -xzvf pat-v.v.vv-xxxx.tgz
      zip: unzip pat-v.v.vv-xxxx.zip
   4. The archive will extract in a new directory tree where all scripts are
      located. Change to this directory.
      cd pat/
   5. Start the installation script ./install.py and answer the questions.
      You can install pat
      a. For one user.
         Start ./install.py as normal user.
	 All necessary scripts will be copied in the sub directory pat/ in
         your home directory (recommended)
      b. For all users
         Start ./install.py as root
	 All necessary scripts will be copied in /usr/local/pat.
	 (recommended only for advanced users)
   6. a. Set your PATH environment variable to the pat-bin-path
         e.g. /home/username/pat/bin
      b. Set the environment variable PAT_LIB_PATH to the pat-lib-path
         e.g. /home/username/pat/lib
      If you are using bash, put the lines:
         export PAT_LIB_PATH="/home/username/pat/lib"
         export PATH=$PATH:/home/username/pat/bin
      in your .bashrc or .bash_profile to make the changes permanent.
   7. Test the installed programs
   8. If everything is working you can remove the intermediate directory.

2b INSTALLATION (Windows TM)
   You need:
   1. Python 2.3 or 2.4 (not tested) for Windows (TM) from http://www.python.org
   2. If you want to use the graphic tools you need PyQt for Windows (TM)
      e.g. from http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk (but it seems that there is
      a dll-library missing). 
   To install pat:
   1. Get the compressed archive (zip) from the pat home page
      http://www.ifp.tuwien.ac.at/pat/
   2. Make a directory where the files will be copied to.
      E.g. C:\Program Files\pat
   3. Extract the archive to the directory above.
      (The installation script included will NOT work under windows (TM).
   4. Set the environment variable PAT_LIB_PATH (e.g. to C:\Program Files\pat\lib)
      and add to your PATH e.g. C:\Program Files\pat\bin
      (Control panel/System/Advanced/Environment Variables)
   5. Test the programs.

3 KNOWN PROBLEMS

  INSTALLATION (windows TM):
   If an error window about a missing dll appears, please google
   for that dll. Download and copy it to your windows system directory.

  GRAPHICS WITH pyton2.3 (Linux and windows TM):
   If a program stops with
   Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<stdin>", line xx, in ?
   ImportError: No module named decimal.py

   You can get decimal.py from a python2.4 installation or from the
   pat home page and copy it to your python library directory.
   Linux: normally /usr/lib/python2.3/
   Windows (TM): C:\Python2.3\lib

  SMALL FONTS, BAD WINDOW SIZE:
   The graphic tools are designed to work on screens with a resolution 1024x768
   or 1280x1024.
   For other resolution the size of the windows or of some fonts may not be
   suitable.
  
   You can change this if you modify some lines in the file grafic.py located
   in the sub directory lib/ of your installation.
  
   Plot.py:
   Size of plot window is bad:
   Search in grafic.py for the line:
   #   Change here if window size of Plot.py does not fit
   Within the next 8 lines you can change the window size.

   Font sizes are bad:
   Search in grafic.py for the line:
   #   Change here if font size of Plot.py does not fit
   Within the next 1 line you can change the font size.
   "font": QFont("sanserif",10) 
   			     |---> Font size in pixels. 
   			  
   Show.py:
   Initial size of plot window is bad:
   Search in grafic.py for the line:
   #   Change here if window size of Show.py does not fit
   Within the next 2 lines you can change the window size.

   Font sizes are bad:
   Search in grafic.py for the line:
   #   Change here if font size of Show.py does not fit
   Within the next 1 line you can change the font size.
   self.FontSize = self.height()/24
   	    Font size in parts of the window height
